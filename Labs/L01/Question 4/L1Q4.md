# Lab 1 Question 4: Class

## Classes Overview

### Transaction Class
```java
class Transaction {
    private Date date;
    private char type;
    private double amount;
    private double balance;
    private String description;
    // ...
}
```

The Transaction class represents individual financial transactions with:
- `date`: Timestamp when transaction occurred (automatically set using `new Date()`)
- `type`: Character indicating transaction type ('W' for withdrawal, 'D' for deposit)
- `amount`: Dollar amount of the transaction
- `balance`: Account balance after the transaction
- `description`: Text description of the transaction

### Account1 Class
```java
class Account1 {
    private String name;
    private int id;
    private double balance;
    private static double annualInterestRate;
    private Date dateCreated;
    private ArrayList<Transaction> transactions;
    // ...
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Constructor Implementation
```java
public Account1(String name, int id, double balance) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
    this.balance = balance;
    this.dateCreated = new Date();  // Creates timestamp when account is opened
    this.transactions = new ArrayList<>();  // Initializes empty transaction list
}
```
- `new Date()` creates a timestamp of when the account was created
- `new ArrayList<>()` initializes an empty list to store future transactions

### 2. Interest Calculation
- `annualInterestRate` is static because all accounts share the same interest rate
- Monthly interest rate = annual rate / 12
- Monthly interest = balance * (monthly rate / 100)

### 3. Transaction Recording
The withdraw and deposit methods automatically record transactions:
```java
public void deposit(double amount) {
    if (amount > 0) {
        balance += amount;
        transactions.add(new Transaction('D', amount, balance, "Deposit"));
    }
}
```
- Creates new Transaction object for each operation
- Stores current balance after transaction
- Maintains chronological history

## Usage Example
```java
Account1 account = new Account1("George", 1122, 1000);
Account1.setAnnualInterestRate(1.5);
account.deposit(30);
account.withdraw(5);
```

## Output Format
The program prints:
1. Account holder details
2. Current balance
3. Interest rate information
4. Complete transaction history with:
   - Transaction date
   - Transaction type (W/D)
   - Amount
   - Resulting balance
   - Description

## Important Implementation Details

### Static vs Instance Variables
- `annualInterestRate` is static because it applies to all accounts
- `balance` and `transactions` are instance variables as they're unique to each account

### Data Validation
- Withdrawals only proceed if sufficient funds exist
- Deposits must be positive amounts

### ArrayList Usage
- Dynamic array list allows unlimited transactions
- Maintains transaction order chronologically
- Enables easy iteration for history display

### Date Handling
- Each transaction automatically timestamped
- Account creation time preserved
- Useful for audit trails and transaction tracking

## Best Practices Demonstrated
1. Encapsulation through private fields
2. Proper getter/setter methods
3. Input validation
4. Transaction logging
5. Clear output formatting
6. Organized code structure

## Testing
The main program demonstrates:
1. Account creation
2. Multiple deposits
3. Multiple withdrawals
4. Interest calculations
5. Transaction history display
