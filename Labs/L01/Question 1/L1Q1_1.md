# L1Q1: Reading a File in Java

## Using 'Scanner'

The `Scanner` class can be used to read the file line by line. This method is simple and effective for small files.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.*;

public class L1Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String file = "L01/L1Q1.txt";
        
        try (Scanner fileScanner = new Scanner(new File(file))) {
            while (fileScanner.hasNextLine()) {
                System.out.println(fileScanner.nextLine());
            }
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found: " + file);
        }
    }
}
```

**Details:**
- Best for: Simple text file reading, parsing input with specific delimiters
- Advantages: Easy to use, built-in methods for parsing different data types
- Disadvantages: Less efficient for large files, no buffering
- Write capability: No, Scanner is read-only
- Use case: When you need to tokenize input or parse various data types from text
- Memory usage: Moderate
- Performance: Good for small files, less efficient for large files

## Using 'BufferedReader'

The BufferedReader class provides an efficient way of reading text from a character-input stream. It buffers characters to provide efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class L1Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String file = "L01/L1Q1.txt";
        
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Details:**
- Best for: Efficient reading of large text files
- Advantages: Buffered reading improves performance, memory efficient
- Disadvantages: Only reads text files, slightly more complex than Scanner
- Write capability: No, but its counterpart BufferedWriter is used for writing
- Use case: When performance is important and you're dealing with large text files
- Memory usage: Low (uses a buffer of fixed size)
- Performance: Excellent for both small and large files

## Using 'Files.readAllLines'

The Files.readAllLines method reads all lines from a file and returns a List<String>. This method is useful for small files as it reads the entire file into memory.

```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class L1Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String file = "L01/L1Q1.txt";
        
        try {
            List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(file));
            for (String line : lines) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Details:**
- Best for: Simple operations on smaller files when you need all lines at once
- Advantages: Very concise, returns all file content as a List
- Disadvantages: Loads entire file into memory, not suitable for very large files
- Write capability: No, but Files.write() is available for writing lists to files
- Use case: When you need all lines in memory for processing
- Memory usage: High (entire file is loaded into memory)
- Performance: Fast for small files, problematic for large files

## Using Files.lines

The Files.lines method returns a Stream<String> that can be used to read all lines from a file. This method is efficient for large files as it processes the file lazily.

```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class L1Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String file = "L01/L1Q1.txt";
        
        try (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(file))) {
            stream.forEach(System.out::println);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Details:**
- Best for: Large files that need to be processed line by line
- Advantages: Lazy loading (doesn't load entire file at once), works with streams
- Disadvantages: Requires Java 8+, potentially more complex for beginners
- Write capability: No, but you can use other NIO methods for writing
- Use case: Processing large files efficiently, or when you want to use Stream operations
- Memory usage: Low (lazy evaluation)
- Performance: Excellent for large files, supports parallel processing
