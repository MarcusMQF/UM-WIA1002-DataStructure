My name is Marcus with matrix number, 24065491. I am 
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this 
subject. This is because this subject is interesting and challenging.

I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will sleep whole semester. Wish me luck!!!

Overall, it has been a great semester learning Data Structures!
