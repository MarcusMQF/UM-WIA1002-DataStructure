# L1Q2: File Manipulation and Appending Content

## Overview
This program demonstrates file manipulation in Java by copying an existing letter, appending new content based on user input, and displaying the results. The program uses various Java I/O classes and exception handling to manage file operations safely.

## Code Structure
The program consists of four main methods:
1. `main()` - Controls program flow and handles exceptions
2. `copyFile()` - Creates a copy of the original file
3. `readAndDisplayFile()` - Displays file contents
4. `appendSecondPartToFile()` - Appends new content based on user input

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Main Method
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    String originalFile = "L01/L1Q1.txt";
    String file = "L01/L1Q2.txt";
    try {
        copyFile(originalFile, file);
        System.out.println("Current content of the file:");
        readAndDisplayFile(file);
        // ...
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```
**Key Features:**
- Defines source and destination file paths
- Uses try-catch block for exception handling
- Orchestrates the sequence of operations

### 2. File Copying Method
```java
private static void copyFile(String sourceFile, String destinationFile) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(sourceFile));
         BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(destinationFile))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            writer.write(line);
            writer.newLine();
        }
    }
}
```
**How it works:**
- Uses `BufferedReader` to efficiently read the source file
- Uses `BufferedWriter` to write to destination file
- Implements try-with-resources for automatic resource management
- Copies line by line, preserving formatting
- Throws IOException for error handling

### 3. File Display Method
```java
private static void readAndDisplayFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    }
}
```
**Features:**
- Uses `BufferedReader` for efficient file reading
- Reads and displays file content line by line
- Automatically closes resources
- Throws IOException for error handling

### 4. Content Appending Method
```java
private static void appendSecondPartToFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName, true))) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Writing date header
        writer.newLine();
        writer.write("Thursday, 18 June 2021.");
        writer.newLine();
        writer.newLine();
        
        // Collecting user input
        System.out.println("How have you performed in the class?");
        String performance = scanner.nextLine();
        // ... more questions ...
        
        // Writing formatted content
        writer.write("It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term...");
        // ... more writing ...
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
**Key Features:**
- Uses `BufferedWriter` in append mode (`true` parameter)
- Implements `Scanner` for user input
- Formats input into coherent text
- Automatically closes resources

## Important Java Classes Used

1. **BufferedReader**
   - Purpose: Efficient reading of text files
   - Benefits: Buffered reading improves performance
   - Usage: Reading source file and displaying content

2. **BufferedWriter**
   - Purpose: Efficient writing to text files
   - Benefits: Buffered writing improves performance
   - Usage: Creating new file and appending content

3. **Scanner**
   - Purpose: Reading user input from console
   - Benefits: Easy parsing of different data types
   - Usage: Collecting user responses

4. **FileReader/FileWriter**
   - Purpose: Basic file I/O operations
   - Usage: Base classes for buffered readers/writers

## Exception Handling
- Uses `IOException` for file operation errors
- Implements try-with-resources for automatic resource management
- Centralizes error handling in main method

## Program Flow
1. Program starts â†’ Creates copy of original file
2. Displays original content
3. Prompts for user input
4. Appends new content
5. Displays final result

## User Input Questions
1. Performance in class
2. Satisfaction with performance
3. Lessons learned from DS
4. Changes in target grade
5. Successful aspects
6. Areas for improvement

## File Operations
1. **Reading Operations**
   - Line-by-line reading using BufferedReader
   - Automatic resource management
   - Error handling for file not found

2. **Writing Operations**
   - Content copying using BufferedWriter
   - Appending new content
   - Maintaining proper formatting

## Best Practices Demonstrated
1. Proper resource management
2. Structured error handling
3. Modular code organization
4. Clear user interaction
5. Efficient file operations

## Example Output Format
```text
Thursday, 19 March 2021.
[Original letter content]

Thursday, 18 June 2021.
[Appended content based on user input]
```
